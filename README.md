# Curious Machines Blog

For this blog, I used the beautiful [Papyrus](https://github.com/hugoferreira/papyrus-theme) theme by Hugo Ferreira.

Modifications:

* I wasn't a fan of the MathJax rendering time, so I switched to the [KaTeX](https://github.com/Khan/KaTeX) library by Khan Academy.
The rendering times are much, much better, and the math looks better.
* I also added Disqus to each blog post.
